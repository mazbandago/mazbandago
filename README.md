I'm a Junior Software Engineer who is passionate about learning software engineering to fulfil my potential. I like to encourage others to take up software engineering as a profession to solve the numerous problems confronting society. I enjoy community building, content creation and learning deeply about Javascript and Developer Advocacy.
I've been studying as a Front-End Engineer for the past couple of months. I'm brushing off my NodeJS skills so I can be an effective Developer Advocate in this space.
